a group of script helps the back-end developer cooperate with the front-end developer well.
As it is know to all, web app consists of two main part, the front-end part including rss, js, and template(jsp, freemarker), the backend-part including java code etc. and each part has its own developer, and developers use some tools to cooperate with each other, the common tool is svn.the front-end developer has modified some files, he commits the changes, and then back-end developer pulls the differences and starts up the app server to check if the modifications satisfy the requirements. 
When a iteration of development just starts, it is ok, but when the development of back-end is finished but the development of front-end is not, it becomes very annoying. The back-end developer has to pull the modifications from the front-end developer. So why not to make this procedure automatic? 
Well, these scripts come for that purpose. it maps the remote resources in the front-end developer's computer to local computer, and when the app server starts up, it can treat them as local resources. when the front-end developer modifys the resources, the app server well reload the resources as if the front-end developer modified locally.
